	<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/design-conference/">page</a> advertising Bloomberg Businessweek Design 2016 that Jonathan showed me. Everything on the page is interactive and it creates sort of an environment. This week I've been trying to think about how I could apply this kind of interactive environment-building to illustration.</p>

	<p>Another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Bloomberg example</a> from Jonathan. This one revolves around some longform reporting, similar to last year's <a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/">"Millennials are Screwed"</a> article in HuffPost Highline (side note, the URL extension in the millennials article is "poor-millennials" which I find hilarious—funny to think that a clever URL can actually add something to a narrative). I think interactivity and (potentially) animated/interactive illustrations add some amazing engagement to storytelling and journalism.</p>

	<p>Twitter inspiration for the week by <a href="https://twitter.com/BreeGoo">@BreeGoo</a>. We're working on "listicles" in Illustrator's Sketchbook, and this is a nice example of how colors and hand-lettering can help make a group of images really feel coherent (aside, obviously, from the shared subject matter).</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Read <i>Waiting for Godot</i> in my writing class. As usual, this reading wasn't necessarily directly applicable to any of my capstone shit, but it reminded me how much I love absurd/nonsense narratives. Could be something to think about while I'm working on my narrative capstone.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>Jonathan told me about <a href="https://www.behance.net/justin5au">Justin Au</a>'s capstone. He retold a familiar story ("Little Red Riding-Hood") using interactive illustration, which is basically what I've been thinking about doing, although I was initially more interested in writing a story (writing minor and all). If I were to retell a story, I'm not sure what story I would use? I've always loved <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> (again, those nonsense narratives!!) but it's soooo overdone/constantly remade. That's kind of unfortunate, because it seems like it would be perfect for what I'm thinking about given how atmospheric it is. May be time to research some other stories?</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>What kinds of stories am I interested in telling? What would be effective stories to retell in this medium?</p>
