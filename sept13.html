	<p>My Twitter inspiration for the week (<a href="https://twitter.com/GreyAnnis/status/1039994197057699847">@GreyAnnis</a>). Obviously the character animation here is enviable, but I also love the subtle animation in the background of the image. Adds such life to the environment. Note to self...</p>

	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>In my composition class we read an incredibly powerful story by David Foster Wallace called "Good Old Neon," basically about a guy's thought process in the time leading up to his suicide (to vastly oversimplify). Not sure if this is really relevant to this blog, but the writing was AMAZING. We talked a lot about how the stylistic decisions in that story, when analyzed, are actually very calculated—despite the fact that it reads very naturally. It reminded me of graphic design in that way.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>During crit in Illustrator's Sketchbook, we discussed the ways in which our sketchbook and "final" illustration work converge and differ. My entire process feels innate to me at this point, so it's been really weird to psychoanalyze it in what seems like all of my classes this year so far. I feel like I'm completely driven by instinct in both my sketchbook and on final pieces. Is that a bad thing? I wonder if that lack of mindfulness is causing me to stagnate in some way.</p>
	<p>We're talking about a similar thing in my composition class except targeted toward literary style. Again, I feel like my writing style is driven by pure instinct. I've always heard that to make style deliberate is to make it seem contrived/that style should evolve organically. I feel like I might not be able to process the effects of these conversations until after the semester is long over.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>Is it better to analyze my process or let things progress naturally?</p>
