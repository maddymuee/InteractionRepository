	<p>Paintings by <a href="https://twitter.com/oshetart">@oshetart</a> on Twitter—thought these were really moody and beautiful despite the lack of a central “character.” Need to start finding illustration inspiration in places other than Twitter.</p>
	<p>I forgot my supplies in Illustrator’s Sketchbook on Tuesday and had to borrow a bunch of Crayola crayons to work. The drawings I made actually turned out really nicely. I felt like I was drawing freely. I think this semester is going to continue last semester’s process of making myself let go and try things out. Need to re-learn to draw for fun.</p>

	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>In my composition class this week, we read two essays on artistic style (an excerpt from <i>Against Interpretation</i> by Susan Sontag and "Form vs. Content, The Eternal Conversation" by John Keene)—specifically literary style, but the discussion can definitely be applied to art.</p>
	<p>The first reading argued that style and content should not be separated, and that in fact style actually informs content (definitely the opposite of conventional design thought). She also declared that art, if it was real art, could not be activist/political regardless of the author’s intentions. This was pretty weird to me given that I’m also in a class called Art & Activism.</p>
	<p>The second reading—a much different take—questioned whether or not style is political and whether art can ever not be political. It got me thinking about whether or not style can be ethical, and if the ethics of style apply to design, where we’re often encouraged to be as invisible as possible.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>We talked about the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s in Art & Activism and that was pretty fascinating (albeit disheartening; so little seems to have changed…).</p>
	<p>The news this week has been terrible.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>Is style ethical? Can we design or draw in more or less ethical ways? What makes art unethical?</p>
	<p>Is there such a thing as activist design? How can I translate my own work into activism?</p>
