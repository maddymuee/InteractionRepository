	<p>Some gorgeous plein air paint inspiration from one of my favorite artists, <a href="http://www.sophiediao.com/">Sophie Diao</a>, on Twitter this week. Her abstraction is awesome. I've been thinking about more interesting/less flat ways to combine color in my drawings per the advice of Shreyas in Illustrator's Sketchbook, and I think this is a great example of color done super well—particularly all of the different colors she's using to create the foreground shadow of the mountain. My inclination would instead be to color that essentially in a flat shade of dark green, so I'm trying to take note of how others use color more interestingly to create depth and activity.</p>

	<p>Work by <a href="https://www.carsonellis.com/">Carson Ellis</a>, an artist I found during research for our upcoming illustrators quiz in sketchbook. Her use of traditional media is bonkers! I feel like I really need to *actually* learn to analog paint because it seems like a lot of the work I'm most drawn to is at least in part analog painted. Might be a project for my (very sparse) downtime.</p>
	<p>Re: all of the style questions lately, I feel like I had a breakthrough with the illustration project I finished this week. I used a totally new method of texture application, thinking a lot more intentionally about where exactly I was applying texture and why depending on the surface of the object. The result was a much more interesting, dimensional piece that still felt "like me," but leveled up. (Shreyas helped me out a lot!)</p>
	<p>I'm also starting to experiment with incorporating textures in my interaction work and figuring out how to come up with a method where the interactive medium vibes with my illustration "style." Haven't gotten there yet, but am at least thinking about it.</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Read some Terry Pratchett this week and was reminded of how much I love fantasy. Might apply to the subject of my capstone. I'm interested in using <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> OR <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> as the content of my project, but kind of worried that that would be cliche?</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>The news has been dour and the subject of Art & Activism this week was "War & Genocide." Noooot great.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>How can I form a visual language that combines illustration and interaction in a way that feels organic?</p>
