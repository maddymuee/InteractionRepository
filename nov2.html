		The Boat
	</div>
	<p>Found some interesting interactive illustration projects this week. <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/"><i>The Boat</i></a> is an interactive graphic novel of considerable length (six chapters), illustrated in ink. I think it's particularly interesting because it's not in a vector or vector-adjacent style whatsoever, but it still works super well. Some of the interactions in here (particularly the mouse movements affecting the images) could be an interesting implementation in my own projects.</p>

		Immersive Garden 2017 Guidelines
	</div>
	<p>Another <a href="https://immersive-g.com/wishes-2017/">site</a>. I think the ambiguity of this one is interesting; nothing is explained. The importance of sound for immersion on this and the site above is also noteworthy, especially given that sound seems kind of contentious in these projects?</p>

		Way to Go
	</div>
	<p>Lucas showed me <a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/">this project</a>. It's essentially a (very ambiguous) game that lives in the browser. It got me thinking about the difference between "games" and "websites"—obviously this game lives on a website but bear with me—how do we make the distinction/where does an interactive website end and a game begin?</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Jonathan sent us <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73">a Medium article</a> about how all websites look the same. I think that article somewhat contextualizes our work in this class within a potential broader professional framework—like, we're extremely bending convention here, but if our work were toned down just a bit it could be professionally viable.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>I've been sick for almost two weeks and haven't observed much of anything.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>What's the difference between a game and a website?</p>
