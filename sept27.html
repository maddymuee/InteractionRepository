	<p>I was doing some research this week in preparation for our scroll assignment on parallax scrolling websites. Above, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/tomato-can-blues/?hp"><i>New York Times</i> article</a> found on a surprisingly helpful <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/parallax-scrolling-1131762">list</a> of beautiful parallax scroll websites from CreativeBloq. I love how the scroll effect is implemented here—it's very simple, just a subtle layered effect being added to the illustrations. Seems like it would be easy enough to implement but still adds a lot to the experience of scrolling down the page.</p>

		Firewatch
	</div>
	<p>From the same list, the <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com/">homepage</a> for the game <i>Firewatch</i>. Doing a similar thing. I appreciate that it's only at the top of the page—it adds a nice touch without being overwhelming.</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>We read <i>Pedro Paramo</i> in writing this week and concurrently I watched <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> for the first time. Both super art. (The second thing is not strictly a reading, but bear with me.)</p>
	<p>Partially because it's what we were explicitly talking about in writing, I thought a lot more about style and influence in relation to the book and the movie. Both of these works were extremely influential in their respective genres. The conclusion my professor came to in writing was that works of art are remembered because their styles are unique. THEN, he told us to "just be ourselves" when we make art. I feel like I'm being given conflicting advice this year: should I think about my "style" or not?</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>I'm having literally the same conversation about style every day in Illustrator's Sketchbook as I am in my writing class. Shreyas is pushing me toward something that I don't really understand. I feel like I'm being told both to do what comes most naturally to me and to intentionally change the way I make things. Unclear!!!</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>what??!!?!?!?!</p>
