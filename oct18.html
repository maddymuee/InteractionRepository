	<p>I went to Austin, TX this week as part of the career roadshow. We toured a number of different interaction design firms (for example, Handsome, Idean, and IBM). I feel like I had a minor revelation...which is that I've been trying to force myself to do things that I'm not interested in for actually a long time now in the interest of doing something "stable."</p>
	<p>I was actually feeling really down the whole time on the trip because I was kind of realizing that I didn't feel excited about any of the places we were touring. However, on the plane ride back I did some introspection and realized that it was actually super helpful for me to go and find out what a career in "interaction design" would <i>actually</i> probably entail, because turns out my notion of it was pretty abstract and kind of off the mark.</p>
	<p>In a way, I'm back to where I started—I've realized fully now that I'm most interested in visual design, art direction, and motion (noooot user research-y things). The GIF above was made by a small design and animation studio called Gunner up in Detroit. I'm going to start seeking out more places like that where I can work toward applying and see if I'd be interested in motion design as a possible profession. Animation is what's always interested and excited me most of all. And then, if not animation, I'll probably look into art direction in branding, publishing, and editorial. (That's not to say this class isn't interesting to me, I'm actually enjoying it a lot and I'm still interested in the incorporation of interaction design into different areas like journalism! But I'm crossing out corporate UI design from my list of possible professions.)</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Haven't read a thing.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>Austin was cool, but probably not the place for me. Weather is kind of a concern. I did REALLY enjoy all of the colorful hand-painted signage and murals. My interest in hand-lettering and incorporating paint into my work continues.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>What am I going to do now?</p>
