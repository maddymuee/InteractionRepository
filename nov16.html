	<p>Woodcut print by <a href="https://twitter.com/p0c0nutmilk">p0c0nutmilk</a> on Twitter. I've been thinking a lot about patterning and bold colors and how these can intersect with food—I'm doing a branding project for a bakery and we're thinking of using graphic, bright imagery like this, so it was a welcome image on my feed even if our output is going to be digital, not woodcut.</p>
	<p>I found another <a href="http://byalicelee.webflow.io/">parallax illustration</a> that I think is fun, although I wonder about its practical application beyond just "looking cool." Certainly it adds depth, but how much does that matter? Seems like this illustration would perhaps be just as effective without the parallax.</p>

		Christoph Niemann
	</div>
	<p>Looked at some interactive work by Christoph Niemann in <i>The New York Times</i> several years back in sketchbook. In this case, the interactivity is very simple—often just GIFs and videos that the user can thumb through. But the movement adds a huge amount of dynamism to his illustrated essay.</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Read <i>Night</i> by Vedrana Rudan, about the Yugoslav War and television. The book is an angry rant from a Croatian woman watching TV all night. Reading this weird stuff in fiction is making me think about the forms of my writing.</p>
	<p>An interesting <a href="https://t.co/MRzsmm2LjY">article</a> about listicles in <i>Thrillist</i> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification">one</a> from <i>The Verge</i> about the spreading aesthetics of Silicon Valley and Airbnb have made me think about the impacts of technology that we don't tend to think about.
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>Tech, journalism, and design can easily have unforeseen impacts.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>How can I make sure I'm writing and designing ethically?</p>
