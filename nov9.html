	<p>The latest from <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiediao">Sophie Diao</a>. I could see this simple, minimally-textured, gradient-based coloring style working well in an interactive environment.</p>

		Paul Rand
	</div>
	<p>Took a bit of a dive back into Paul Rand's work while researching for a freelance project I'm doing under David Rygiol's direction. I so admire the simplicity here!!! I feel like I always overwork my stuff. His work is instantly memorable just because of the colors and shapes. Sigh...</p>
	<p>This week was kind of another breakthrough in terms of my own work. I started using my own drawings(!) in Interaction, something I honestly should have been doing and have wanted to do from the start (why it took me this long is a mystery). Learned some more JavaScript. In Sketchbook, found a way to make drawing a Rube Goldberg machine (blech) be genuinely fun. Seems like the move now is just to give in to my whims as much as possible?</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>Have been reading some fiction about TV including "The Veldt" by Ray Bradbury, a speculative fiction sci-fi/horror piece about a VR room in a smart home. It has been fascinating to read about people's anxieties about a technology that is now becoming antiquated. I feel pretty anxious about certain emerging technologies right now—maybe kids in the future will laugh at me, too.</p>
	<p>Started re-reading <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>. I actually forgot how spooky it is and now I'm having second thoughts about using it rather than <i>Wonderland</i>. We'll see.
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>Went to a studio tour at Atomic Dust and was struck by Mike Spakowski's comments about making your own stuff constantly. I already know that in theory, but it's good to be reminded.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>How can I flesh out the smaller exercises I made in class this week into a bigger project that maintains people's engagement?</p>
