		Meg Hunt
	</div>
	<p>I've recently rediscovered <a href="http://www.meghunt.com/">Meg Hunt</a>. She works with a lot of different tools, both traditional and digital. I think she's a great example of intentional texture use.</p>

		Darren Booth
	</div>
	<p><a href="http://darrenbooth.com/">Darren Booth</a> is a great lettering artist who I found while I was researching for a hand-lettering assignment. I'm interested in hand-lettering but don't feel confident in my abilities!</p>

		Sarah Beth Morgan
	</div>
	<p>I've been looking at the work of <a href="http://sarahbethmorgan.com">Sarah Beth Morgan</a>, an illustrator, designer, and art director for animation and motion graphics. Her art is deceptively simple; she uses textures and colors really wonderfully and subtly. I'm finding myself drawn pretty often to art direction positions and the work of art directors.</p>
	<p>Work has been in a rut this week. I am having trouble in Interaction in particular, pushing through the lack of defined expectations/making myself experiment. I'm sort of realizing I don't really have fun sketching/playing/experimenting without a defined goal and I'm wondering if that's something I can change about myself.</p>
	<h2>readings</h2>
	<p>In Interaction, we read about whether or not the web is dead or dying in favor of apps. Concurrently, in Advertising in the Digital Age, we talked about how apps might be creating a dangerous bubble. It seems like opinions are divided on this subject. I'm interested in whether this bubble might pop.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>Digital illustrations with analog components are often the ones I'm most drawn to.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>Can I make myself enjoy the means if there isn't an end in sight?</p>
