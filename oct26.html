		Jarom Vogel
	</div>
	<p>I discovered Jarom Vogel this week. He's basically doing exactly what I want to do with interactive illustration!! I might have to email him and ask him some questions, because I feel like his skills might be a little beyond my reach at the moment. But his parallax stuff, especially for mobile application, is amazing. And I love his illustrations beyond that too.</p>
	<p>I went to a motion graphics workshop as part of St. Louis Design Week and also fiddled around a bit in AfterEffects this week. Motion remains a big interest of mine, and I'd like to explore AfterEffects further to see what I can do with it and how it can blend with my illustration work. I think designing for motion would be interesting.</p>
	<p>Finally, Illustrator's Sketchbook visited Riso Hell this week to print our risograph illustrations. The project was definitely a challenge! I had to think in a completely different way from my usual illustration mentality. My prints only turned out okay, but it was a great learning experience and really fun to see what my classmates pulled off.</p>

		Tyrus Wong
	</div>
	<p>Read an interesting piece in <i>The New York Times</i> about an artist named Tyrus Wong, who did absolutely incredible art direction for Disney on <i>Bambi</i> and was not properly credited for his work for decades due to racism. His paintings are beautiful; the way he simplifies form and uses color is totally unique. His life story is sad. A reminder that a lot of people can be screwed over in the making of amazing art.</p>
	<h2>observations</h2>
	<p>I remain particularly drawn to environmental illustration. Might be time to see how much I can push that with interactive or motion elements.</p>
	<h2>questions</h2>
	<p>How can I begin to blend illustration, interaction, and motion in a way that feels like "me"?</p>
